The motive of these observations was to use dimension-reducing methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to examine magnetometer data on Galileo MAG.
This is official NASAâ€™s dataset of Galileo MAG high-resolution magnetic field. 
The Galileo Orbiter supports a complement of fields and particles instruments mapped out to supply data required from magnetometer. 
The dataset that I have worked on to examine variations of data from Solar Equatorial (ISE) coordinates of Ida astroid.
